          <h3>A strange story</h3>
          <h3>January 17th, 2015</h3>
          <div>
            Immagine one day you open your eyes and you find yourself in a place you don't know.<br />
            You are surrounded by creatures, you don't really know what they are, but for some strange reason you are not scared.<br />
            Everything looks so strange and amazing... nothing you've seen before. Oh wait... where were you before? You don't remember...<br />
            It looks like these creatures know what they are doing, they are not hurting you, you kinda feel protected by them.<br />
            You want to communicate with them, but they don't seem to understand you, neither you understand them...<br />
            Time passes, you realize that, after all, these creatures are not that different from you and little by little you see that they are trying to communicate with you and sometimes you understand what they mean. You try to communicate with them too, emulating what they do and, sometimes, it seems to work.<br />
            You start to feel like you belong with them, but still, no idea of what the hell is going on.<br />
            Year passes and you manage to easily communicate with them, so you start asking questions, but it’s hard… what should you exactly ask?<br />
            You just start asking any question pops up in your mind. They reply, but every time their answers are vague, sometimes inconsistent… one gives you a different answer from the other… someone even talks about magic. The general answer seems to be: “Don’t worry, all is fine… you’ll understand.”<br />
            You’re kinda disappointed, angry sometimes… but it really looks like they want good for you and they know better.<br />
            You explore what’s around you and things get weirder and weirder… some of them are amazingly beautiful, other are horrifying.<br />
            You get to meet other creatures… some of them are very similar to you and, like you, they don’t know much about what is going on…<br />
            You really want to find out the truth, but the more the time passes, the more you realize that no one really knows much or, at least, that is what they’re telling you.<br />
            It seems like your only choice is to believe them…<br />
            Most of the creatures seem to have given up on finding the truth, they just go ahead with their lives, hoping eventually they will understand… or not even that, they just seem to be fine with not knowing.<br />
            Other have very strong beliefs that there must be a way to find out what is going on and that all can be explained, but the deeper they go, the more things get complex.<br />
            Other again, believe there are other creatures, unknown to them who are orchestrating the whole thing… they say there are notes from them that they left to other creatures in the past.<br />
            You are very confused and your only choice is to pick one of these paths other are following and hope for the best.<br />
            <br />
            Believe it or not, this whole story happened to me. It all begun on February 8th, 1986 and it is still going on...
